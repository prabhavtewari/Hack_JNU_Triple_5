<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Have you ever spent your time endlessly scrolling through google after a cold or sore throat, trying to figure out what has happened to you only to find gruesome results of you having either heart disease or cancer?
We should not have to deal with that, and therefore with the rising cases of misunderstood self-treatments and concerns for common healthcare in general, Team Triple_5 created Sage to amalgamate all the necessary steps for online treatment in a simple easy to use web application.
